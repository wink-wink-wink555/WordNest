## 💡 Why I Built This

As someone who has been (and honestly, still is) tormented by English vocabulary, I've tried every word-learning app out there... (´･ω･`)

**However, the reality is brutal:**
- 🤢 **Counter-intuitive UI**: Either too flashy to find the focus, or just plain eyesores 😟
- 😵 **Repeating Known Words**: Constantly pushing words I've already mastered—wasting time and crushing motivation 🥺
- 📚 **Vast, Aimless Libraries**: Staring at tens of thousands of words without knowing where to start 🥹
- ⚡ **Pathetic Efficiency**: Realizing after hours of study that most of the work was repetitive, with very few actual "problem words" conquered 😭

**When I reached my breaking point, I thought:** If nothing out there works, why not build my own! (ง •̀_•́)ง

Thus, WordNest was born~ A vocabulary handbook truly focused on **YOUR specific new words**. Say goodbye to useless repetition and make every minute of study count!

**Developer**: [@wink-wink-wink555](https://github.com/wink-wink-wink555) | A college student once scarred by vocabulary apps (◕‿◕)

### 🎯 Architecture Highlights

**Three-Tier Architecture - Separation of Concerns**

1. **Routing Layer (Routes)**
* Handles HTTP requests and responses.
* Parameter validation and error handling.
* Modular management using Flask Blueprints.


2. **Service Layer (Services)**
* Encapsulates core business logic.
* Reusable functional modules.
* Decoupled from the routing layer for improved testability.


3. **Data Layer (Models)**
* SQLAlchemy ORM data models.
* Database operation encapsulation.
* Supports switching between multiple database types.



**Design Advantages** ✨

* 📦 **Modular**: Clear responsibilities for each layer, easy to understand.
* 🔧 **Maintainable**: Logical organization minimizes the impact of changes.
* 🧪 **Testable**: Independent business logic facilitates unit testing.
* 🚀 **Extensible**: Adding new features simply requires extending the corresponding layers.

## 🔧 AI Magic Configuration

Want to unlock AI superpowers? Follow these steps to set it up~ ✨

### 🧠 Local AI Assistant Setup (Ollama + Qwen)

Let the AI live on your computer to generate custom examples and study notes:

1. **Install Ollama** (The home for local AI)

```bash
# Visit [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/) to download the installer
# Install it like any regular software—just click through (◡‿◡)
   
# After installation, download the super-smart Qwen model
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b

```

2. **Configure DeepSeek API** (The Knowledge Graph Wizard)

Edit the `config.py` file and replace the default value with your key:

```python
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'

```

### Database Configuration

Uses SQLite by default, but supports other databases:

```bash
# PostgreSQL Example
DATABASE_URI=postgresql://username:password@localhost/wordnest

# MySQL Example  
DATABASE_URI=mysql://username:password@localhost/wordnest

```

### Deployment Configuration

For production deployment, use Gunicorn:

```bash
# Install gunicorn (included in requirements.txt)
pip install gunicorn

# Start the production server
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app

```

### 🏗️ Architecture Development Guide

If you wish to add new features, please follow these layered architecture principles:

**1. Adding New Business Logic**

```
Step 1: Create or extend a service class in services/
Step 2: Add corresponding route handlers in routes/
Step 3: If a new page is needed, add a template in templates/
Step 4: Update config.py (if new configuration items are needed)

```

**2. Code Organization Principles**

* ✅ **Routes**: Only handle HTTP request/response; call service layer methods.
* ✅ **Services**: Contain all business logic; should be reusable.
* ✅ **Models**: Handle data models and database operations only.
* ❌ **Avoid**: Directly operating on the database within routes.
* ❌ **Avoid**: Handling HTTP request objects within the service layer.

**3. Example: Adding a "Favorite" Word Feature**

```python
# Step 1: services/word_service.py
class WordService:
    @staticmethod
    def toggle_favorite(word_str):
        # Business logic here
        pass

# Step 2: routes/word_routes.py
@word_bp.route('/favorite/<word>', methods=['POST'])
def favorite_word(word):
    if WordService.toggle_favorite(word):
        return jsonify({'success': True})
    return jsonify({'error': 'Operation failed'}), 400

```
